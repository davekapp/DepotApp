This is my modified version of the store application built along with Agile Web Programming with Ruby on Rails from PragProg. It's a great book, take a look at it.

There's a lot here that probably wouldn't be done in a real web store, but as as a project primarily made to learn along with, I think it served its purpose admirably.
